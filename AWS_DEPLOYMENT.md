# AWS Cloud Deployment Services

## Overview
Brief overview of AWS services for deploying the PDF Search Engine.

## Core AWS Services

### 1. Compute & Load Balancing
- **Amazon ECS with Fargate**: Serverless container hosting for the FastAPI application
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Traffic distribution with SSL termination and health checks

### 2. Search & Database
- **Amazon OpenSearch Service**: Managed Elasticsearch for PDF content search
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**: User management and metadata storage

### 3. Storage
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for PDF files, processed data, and backups
- **Amazon EFS**: Shared file system for temporary processing

### 4. Security
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall for API protection
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure credential storage
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: SSL/TLS certificate management
- **AWS IAM**: Access control and permissions

### 5. Networking
- **Amazon VPC**: Isolated network with private/public subnets
- **Security Groups**: Network-level firewall rules

### 6. Monitoring
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logging, metrics, and alerting
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for performance monitoring

### 7. CI/CD
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automated deployment pipeline
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Build and test automation
- **Amazon ECR**: Docker container registry

## Deployment Strategy
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation or Terraform
- **Container Deployment**: ECS with auto-scaling
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime updates

## Security Features
- VPC with private subnets for databases
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- JWT-based API authentication
- Rate limiting and input validation

This architecture provides scalable, secure, and cost-effective deployment for the PDF search engine.
